Welcome to the repository for my blog, which you can visit at https://tbalza.net.

The blog is built using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), a popular static site generator. Additionally, it's equipped with a GitHub Workflow action that automatically deploys the updated site whenever modifications are made to the main branch.

If you're interested in replicating this setup, I've put together a [step-by-step guide](https://tbalza.net/posts/blog_hugo/blog_hugo/) for your convenience. Enjoy!
